        <p id="bio">Daniel S. Wassmer is an attorney in private practice in Bucks County. In 2020, he ran as a Libertarian candidate for Attorney General, and, in 2022, as a Keystone Party candidate for the U.S. Senate. In a 2020 Ballotpedia “Candidate Conversation,” Wassmer touted his more than 30 years of varied legal experience and expressed support for gun rights, objection to government overreach, and described then-AG candidate Josh Shapiro (and Shapiro’s Republican opponent) as “literally garbage.” More currently, his Facebook profile reveals a dislike of Trump and the Trump administration’s approach to international affairs, health matters, business matters, more.</p>
        <p>Daniel S. Wassmer is running for Judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania as a liberal candidate</p>
